# Default Community Health Files

You can add default community health files to the root of a public repository called `.github` that is owned by an organization or user account.
GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository owned by the account that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the `.github` folder
- the `docs` folder

For more information see [the official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
